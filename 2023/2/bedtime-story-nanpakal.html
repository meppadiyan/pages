                        <p>Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains, lived a man named Sundar. Sundar lived with his parents. He had a loving wife and beautiful little daughter. They were a happy family. Sundar used to work hard to provide for his family, but, one day he went off to work and never returned.</p><p>Everyone in town assumed that Sundar was dead. His parents, wife and daughter mourned his loss and tried to move on with their lives, but, they could never forget him.</p><p>But, two years later, Sundar found himself in a bus on the outskirts of his village, with no memory of where he had been or what happened to him. For him, it felt like he woke up from a long nap.</p><p>He got out of the bus and walked back to his village. He then went on doing his chores. He changed his clothes, took a bath, went to the temple, had tea from the local shop, chit chatted with the crowd there. But, he felt something was off. Sundar noticed people behave a bit differently towards him. </p><p>After having breakfast from the village shop, he went to visit his barber for a haircut. There he saw himself in front of a mirror and it’s at that moment he realised that he is in someone else’s body.</p><p>Perhaps he woke up in some one else’s body who was passing through the village in that bus - He thought to himself. <br>He didn’t know how long this would last. Maybe until he goes to sleep again. </p><p>He realised that life is full of surprises and that he miss his family so much. What he considered mundane moments before now seem the most precious moments in his life.</p><p>He had a small nap in the afternoon. And when he woke up, he was no longer Sundar. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
