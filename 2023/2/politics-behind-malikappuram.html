                        <p>Even before Malikappuram hit theatres, there had been a lot of coordinated attempts against UnniMukundan and team. Here is a list of them while it remains to be seen who’s behind all these attacks. </p><h2 class="section-heading">The Bala Issue</h2><p>Just as when makers announced the release date of Malikappuram, Bala, Unni Mukundan's co-star in his previous movie "Shafeeqinte Santhosham" (which Unni had produced) started creating rumours that Unni Mukundan paid remuneration only to female leads, and did not pay male cast and crew. These allegations later turned out to be complete farse when Unni released payment receipts of each and everyone in question, and clarified that no one received special treatment from him.Luckily, for Unni, all transactions were through bank which made it possible to clear the air. However, the undue media coverage this issue enjoyed was a bit sceptical given that the allegations had little merit even to start with. </p><h2 class="section-heading">Violent attacks and Boycott calls</h2><p>After the movie got released, Word of Mouth was extremely positive and with higher than expected footfalls, theatres increased their screen allocation. But, there was a section who were unimpressed. Instead of finding faults in the movie(an uphill task) they resorted to go against people who favoured this movie. One of their early target was Pragilesh, whose shop they vandalised just for posting a few good lines about the movie. Speaking of intolerance ….</p><a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kochuveedu-1e448.appspot.com/o/blogImages%2Fmeppadiyan%2F49675f10-ac17-11ed-9bd3-35a015ba7c03.jpg?alt=media&token=529bf3cc-26b5-4f0e-8b98-e94f26268460" alt="..." /></a><span class="caption text-muted">This was the comment made by Pragilesh which angered the anti-Sabarimala, anti-Malikappuram ecosystem. Interestingly, he didn’t post much - Just that the movie was good. </span><p><a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/national/local-shop-vandalised-in-kerala-after-shopowner-praises-movie-on-sabarimala-in-social-media-post-news-250744/amp">A local shop in Kerala’s Malappuram district was attacked by unidentified people after shop owner praised Indian-Malayalam Movie Malikappuram</a></p><h2 class="section-heading">Online bullies and unanswered questions</h2><p>Feeding negativity ( Degrading ) is a strategy employed by some online reviewers whose primary purpose is to fish  for more subscribers.<br>There was this particular YouTuber who openly favoured Kantara for its theme, but, blamed Malikappuram for the same theme which is Bhakti/Devotion. He’s been incessantly making videos against Malikappuram and even went below the belt comments to demean the little girl protagonist’s dressing. This prompted Unni to make a call to this YouTuber which got a bit salty. No surprise! <br>However, the YouTuber posted selective parts of the conversation where Unni got angry at him; which was enough for the anti-Malikappuram brigade. Though it was mostly locker room talk, what was intriguing from this event is the support this YouTuber received from main stream Malayalam Industry. Dileesh Pothan - actor/Director shocked everyone when he shared this YouTuber’s post at the same time this YouTuber was running hate campaigns against Unni.<br><br>Akhil Marar, another director later disclosed how Unni told him that someone inside the movie industry is targeting him and his films.</p><h2 class="section-heading">Fabricated cases</h2><p>Just when you think enough is enough,  there is one fabricated case against Unni from 2017, which was filed by a lady for wrongful misconduct. The fact that her name is not made private in the court proceeding suggests it’s not a sexual misconduct case. But, after the success of Malikappuram, there are a few mainstream channels including MediaOne, Mathrubhumi who ran a story insinuating that it’s a case of sexual harassment. Unni is known to take an open stand in public and there are a few instances where Feminists took offense to some of his. “If you can’t convince them, confuse them” seems to be the current strategy of this hate brigade. </p><h2 class="section-heading">The Online Trolls</h2><p>It was clearly evident during the Sabarimala Issue as how a section of people openly trolled Ayyappa devotees for expressing their stand. It’s no surprise the movie whose name itself triggers the anti-Malikappuram brigade for busting the fake campaign that Sabarimala is closed for all women. Also it’s one movie that shows Hindu customs in a positive light, which is sadly a big taboo now in Malayalam industry. Some of the trolls were focused at how Unni in real life is different from the larger than life character he plays in the movie. For eg: real life Unni gets angered at a troll, eats Non-Veg, bla bla bla.These arguments didn’t have much teeth,but, all the more suggestive of how far they are willing to silence alternate voices in film industry.</p><h2 class="section-heading">Final thoughts</h2><p>None of the above stuff really mattered as the movie now crossed 100 Crores of Business worldwide and has permanently etched its place in Indian Cinema. However, it’s worth noting how difficult it’s for a first generation actor to get his feet in Malayalam Movie Industry where nepotism runs much deeper than even Bollywood.</p>
