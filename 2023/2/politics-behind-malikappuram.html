                        <p>Even before Malikappuram hit theatres, there had been a lot of coveted attempts and UnniMukundan and team Malikappuram were constantly dragged into issues and controversies.</p><h2 class="section-heading">The Bala Issue</h2><p>Just before a month of Malikappuram Release, Bala, Unni Mukundan's co-star in his previous movie "Shafeeqinte Santhosham" started creating rumours that Unni Mukundan did not pay not only  him, but also the director and other artists who worked on the movie. It was Unni Mukundan's second production venture. This rumour, created by Bala, later proved to be a complete farse, but, not before dozens of online channels jumping the gun and taking a dig at Unni.</p><h2 class="section-heading">Violent attacks and Boycott calls</h2><p>The movie started receiving terrific Word of Mouth and within one week itself theatres increased their screen allocation. it didn’t falter even at the big releases like Avatar,Varisu,Thunivu and other releases EnnalumEntaliya,Thankam,Alone,Avatar and Nanpakal. But, there was a section of reviewers and politicians who were unimpressed. They were expecting the movie to fail. But, when it didn’t happen they resorted to usual whatabbotary with something naive as “Movie thanked Mohan Bhagwat” in the beginning credits;  while in reality the beginning credits had also thanked Pinarayi Vijayan also who’s at the other end of the political spectrum. <br>Interstingly. they stopped finding fault in the movie and rather on people who shared good opinions in social media. One such unfortunate guy was Pragilesh, whose shop was vandalised on Jan 1st  just for posting a few good lines about the movie. </p><a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kochuveedu-1e448.appspot.com/o/blogImages%2Fmeppadiyan%2F49675f10-ac17-11ed-9bd3-35a015ba7c03.jpg?alt=media&token=529bf3cc-26b5-4f0e-8b98-e94f26268460" alt="..." /></a><span class="caption text-muted">This was the comment made by Pragilesh which angered the anti-Sabarimala, anti-Malikappuram ecosystem. Interestingly, he didn’t post much - Just that the movie was good. </span><p><a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/national/local-shop-vandalised-in-kerala-after-shopowner-praises-movie-on-sabarimala-in-social-media-post-news-250744/amp">A local shop in Kerala’s Malappuram district was attacked by unidentified people after shop owner praised Indian-Malayalam Movie Malikappuram</a></p><h2 class="section-heading">Encounter with Online bully and some unanswered questions</h2><p>Feeding negativity is a strategy employed by some online reviewers whose primary purpose is to get more subscribers.There is a term for such people - Degraders.<br>There was this particular YouTuber who has been complaining why Kerala doesn’t release good movies like Kantara, and when they did release Malikappuram he took a hypocritical stand and blamed how Malikappuram is selling Bhakti/Devotion. He’s been incessantly making videos on Malikappuram and blaming the little girl protagonist for her dressing and UnniMukundan as well for how he’s been raised etc. The naive Unni thought it’d be better to explain himself and gave a call to this YouTuber which got salty. The YouTuber posted selective parts of the conversation and it was food and batter for haters for a while. <br>But, what was intriguing from this event is the support this YouTuber was getting from Malayalam Film Fraternity itself. Dileesh Pothan - actor/Director shared this YouTuber’s post at the same time this YouTuber was running hate campaigns against Unni. <br>Akhil Marar, another director shared how Unni sensed that some people in the movie fraternity were planning to nosedive this movie.</p><h2 class="section-heading">Fake Cases against Unni</h2><p>Just as when you think it’s too much, this also happened. Unni is known to take an open stand in public and most of the times Feminists has taken offense to that. Four years back, one lady registered IPC 354  against Unni after she felt offended by his statements. Unni’s advocate settled the case off court for an undisclosed amount. But, after the roaring success of Malikappuram her advocate went back on the settlement and claims that the documented were forged. It’s common sense to understand how fabricated and  opportunistic the case is; but, the biased media is posting news without getting into specificity ( not even publishing the IPC no:) to make it look like it’s a sexual harassment case. It’s common knowledge how media does hit jobs to demand money from celebrities; but, for Unni, it feels a bit unfair as he is a first generation actor with no godfather in the industry.</p><a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kochuveedu-1e448.appspot.com/o/blogImages%2Fmeppadiyan%2Faece9380-ac23-11ed-8cbf-31cd9b76ee7c.jpg?alt=media&token=ca0e02c1-4707-4cbd-a200-1be84d3b12c7" alt="..." /></a><span class="caption text-muted">Truth about forged cases against Unni Mukundan</span>
