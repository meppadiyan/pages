                        <blockquote class="blockquote">I want to watch this again with my family. I want to show this to my daughter.</blockquote><span class="text-muted">These were the exact words my North Indian friend said as we got out of the theatre. </span><p>As Unni Mukundan in one of his interviews rightly said, watching movies from home is a personal affair, but, theatre experience is a social affair.<br><br>And you cannot deny that on yourself for too long, coz, man IS a social animal. Shared joy is double joy. Shared sorrow is half sorrow.So when I witnessed the standing ovation at the end of the movie, which is very rare in this part of the world, I said to myself - “That’s about right !”. </p><h2 class="section-heading">The Plot and Storyline</h2><p>To me, the plot can be summarised as “A girl on a mission”. And how she discovers hope at the darkest hour in her life and the universe conspires to get what she wants. I was truly moved by the journey of the young girl in the movie. Her combination of innocence and determination was a powerful force and watching her make a daring journey to make things right was both heartwarming and inspiring. I’m probably at a risk of being called a moron when I tell you this -  Malikappuram gave me Leon type vibes. </p><a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kochuveedu-1e448.appspot.com/o/blogImages%2Fmeppadiyan%2F53c7f410-a870-11ed-9bc2-dffe90c5a945.jpg?alt=media&token=05cbe26a-b0e8-479b-8fa7-aaa21c7f10e4" alt="..." /></a><span class="caption text-muted">Malikappuram, like Leon tells a story of a young girl’s determination and how far they are willing to go to make things right.
</span><h2 class="section-heading">Hard to execute premise</h2><p>It can be difficult to come up with a script that effectively shows the combination of a girl’s innocence and determination because  it requires a delicate balance between the two traits.Inorder to strike the right balance, a writer must carefully develop their character’s backstory and personality, to highlight their sense of purpose.<br>It’s not an easy task and that’s probably why Abhilash Pillai, movie’s scriptwriter had to wait 4 years before there were any takers.</p><p><a href="https://meppadiyan.com/2023/2/politics-behind-malikappuram">The politics behind Malikappuram. How it survived the Hate Campaigns.</a></p><h2 class="section-heading">Story Layers and Character Reveals</h2><p>Another area where the movie stands out , and would probably enjoy a cult status in future, is the way it has layered its characters. As the movie progress, our initial impression of the characters (especially that of Kallu - the girl protagonist and her cousin Peeyush) changes. They were not some caricature of innocence and determination, but, a lot lot more.By the end of first half the audience gets deeply invested in these two little characters so much that the fight scenes that follows are not just a  visual extravaganza, but, a personal affair. You can find yourself rooting for them at every step of the way. </p><h2 class="section-heading">Writing and Character Development</h2><p>If Content is King, Script is the KingMaker. Malikappuram’s strong hold is it’s script. If you observe carefully, you’ll find that every dialogue, incident in the movie is a carefully planted one. This is the type of movie that warrants a second watch when you appreciate it even more. </p><h2 class="section-heading">The Unni Mukundan Effect</h2><p>2022 was undoubtedly the year of Unni Mukundan. His come back streak started with Meppadiyan in Jan 2022, and quickly escalated with Malikappuram towards year end. And with just one movie Unni Mukundan proved what he is capable of. It’s a combination of acting, charisma, swag level that throned the big Ms in Malayalam Movie Industry. After witnessing how Unni Mukundan reinvented himself, it’s evident how he is going to take their place as their rightful heir.</p>
