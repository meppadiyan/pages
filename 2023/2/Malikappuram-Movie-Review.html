                        <blockquote class="blockquote">I want to watch this again with my family. I want to show this to my daughter.</blockquote><span class="text-muted">These were the exact words my North Indian friend said as we got out of the theatre. </span><p>As Unni Mukundan in one of his interviews rightly said, watching movies from home is a personal affair, but, theatre experience is a social affair.<br><br>And you cannot deny that on yourself for too long, coz, man IS a social animal. Shared joy is double joy. Shared sorrow is half sorrow.<br><br>So when I witnessed the standing ovation at the end of the movie, which is very rare in this part of the world, I said to myself - “That’s about right !”. </p><h2 class="section-heading">The Plot and Storyline</h2><p>To me, the plot is nothing more than “A girl on a mission”. And how she discovers hope at the darkest hour in her life and the universe conspires to get what she wants. It’s an interesting combination of innocence and maturity, and I’m probably at a risk of being called a moron when I tell you this -  Malikappuram gave me Leon type vibes. </p><a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kochuveedu-1e448.appspot.com/o/blogImages%2Fmeppadiyan%2F53c7f410-a870-11ed-9bc2-dffe90c5a945.jpg?alt=media&token=05cbe26a-b0e8-479b-8fa7-aaa21c7f10e4" alt="..." /></a><span class="caption text-muted">Malikappuram, like Leon tells a story of a young girl’s determination and how far they are willing to go to make things right.
</span><h2 class="section-heading">More Risk More Reward</h2><p>Both movies though different in their own genre, there are a few similarities that you can’t deny while thinking about it. In Leon, the girl’s motivation was a more powerful feeling - VENGEANCE, but, in Malikappuram it’s a tender one - LOVE - which is even harder to justify for their subsequent actions. So, for this to work you need a tight screenplay, impeccable editing and exceptional performances from actors. That’s probably why Abhilash Pillai, movie’s scriptwriter had to wait 4 years before there were any takers.</p><p><a href="https://Google.com">The politics behind Malikappuram. How it survived the Hate Campaigns.</a></p><h2 class="section-heading">Story Layers and Character Reveals</h2><p>Another area where the movie stands out , and would probably enjoy a cult status in future, is the way it has layered its characters. As the movie progress, our initial impression of the characters (especially that of Kallu - the girl protagonist and her cousin Peeyush) changes. We get to know more about them, their will power, their internal motivation.By the end of first half the audience gets invested in these two little characters so much that the fight scenes that follows are not just a  visual extravaganza, but, a personal affair. </p><h2 class="section-heading">Writing and Character Development</h2><p>If Content is King, Script is the KingMaker. Malikappuram’s strong hold is it’s script. If you observe carefully, you’ll find that every dialogue, incident in the movie is a carefully planted one. This is the type of movie that warrants a second watch when you appreciate it even more. </p><h2 class="section-heading">The Unni Mukundan Effect</h2><p>2022 was undoubtedly the year of Unni Mukundan. His come back streak started with Meppadiyan in Jan 2022, and quickly escalated with Malikappuram towards year end. And with just one movie Unni Mukundan proved what he is capable of. It’s a combination of acting, charisma, swag level that throned the big Ms in Malayalam Movie Industry. After witnessing how Unni Mukundan has reinvented himself, it’s evident who is the one true heir to their stardom. And it’s none other than Unni Mukundan - the man himself. </p>
